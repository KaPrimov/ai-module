    "The goal of this study is to see to what extend the odds, which bookmakers assign to games can be used in predicting the final outcome. The data with the odds is taken from *oddsportal* and the data with the games is taken from various sources. Also would be measured the accuracy of odds such as both teams to score, more or less than 2.5 goals and both team to or not to score. The data is for the five major leagues - La Liga, Premier League, Bundesliga, Ligue 1 and Seria A and we will see where and how the predictions and reality are different for the leagues."
